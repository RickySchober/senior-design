## Requirements

1. Profiler can be launched from shore or in shallow waters of 100 meters deep.
2. Profiler has an operational range of 1 kilometer from shore or 4 hours of continuous operation.
3. While on the surface of the water, Profiler must know its location within 5 meters of accuracy (based on GPS variance).
4. While on the surface of the water, Profiler must have communication range of 1 kilometer.
5. While on the surface of the water, Profiler must be able to navigate to remotely commanded GPS waypoints with 5 meters of accuracy.
6. Profiler is capable of station-keeping in rough marine environments within X meters. (ask Kitts
7. User can transmit GPS-waypoint commands to profiler with X% success rate.
8. Profiler monitors the health of its power system & leaks.
9. Profiler weighs X kilograms and has a volume of X liters.
10. While on the surface of the water, Profiler must transmit its location and health to the user every X minutes.
11. Upon reaching GPS waypoints, Profiler must dive and descend to a maximum depth of X meters.
12. While descending, Profiler must know its depth with X meters uncertainty.
13. While descending, Profiler descends vertically with less than X meters of lateral drifting.
14. While descending, Profiler must know its surface coordinates with X meters of uncertainty.
15. Profiler can be remotely commanded to complete a sequence of dives at commanded GPS waypoints
16. Profiler can be unpacked, booted up, and be ready for deployment in the water in less than X minutes.
17. Profiler returns to user after mission ends.
18. While descending, Profiler captures X water-samples at user-commanded depths with less than X meters of error.
19. Profiler measures turbidity and temperature with X% accuracy and X% resolution every X seconds.
20. Cluster of profilers capable of multi-robot SFAN.
21. Profiler completes X water column-profiles in 4 hours.
