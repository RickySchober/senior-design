## Spicer's background
* Researcher for the army corp of engineers research division
* He does marine research, R and D
* Surf zone autonomy for army corps missions and expeditionary missions
* he also does civil missions (dredging and beach surveying, protecting navigation ports)
* He wants something for dredging operations: moving sand, excavation; he wants to be more conscious of environmental impacts while dredging. Protecting reefs, vegetation. Dredging creates plumes of sediment that are carried by ocean currents, dispersing them over sensitive environmental environments, shutting down dredges;
* Where we might come in is monitoring the extent of sediment plumes, providing dredgers realk time information.

## Questions
- Could you describe the tasks in your daily routine that require water-sampling or underwater data collection?
  - He wants turbidity sensors, mapping currents in the surf zone (wave heights from IMU)
  - mapping depths in the surf zone
  - At depths of 100 meters
  - The MORE valuable areas are the shallow areas: this is where the reefs are, the vegetation, etc (as shallow as six inches)
- How many water-column profiles do you do in a given day? How long are those missions?
  - He wants the profiler to map the EDGE of the plume, he wants to track the plume as it moves
  - Dredging is a 4 day process
  - he wants a real time monitoring system of plumes
- How fast do these plumes go typically in typical conditions?
  - < 2m/s
- How deep are those water-column profiles?
- How large of an area do you typically canvass in a given day of profiles?
  - If in an inlet
  - Kilometers of range
- Do you have an exact latitude, longitude for the locations you want to profile? Or is a more general location?
- How harsh are the marine environments that you take profiles of?
  - Certain wave conditions, dredgers won't operate;
  - if on the ocean side of the inlet, meter high waves
  - or if he's workin in an estuary, typically clamer waters
  - Seastate: 3 (but don't use this lol, only works for deepwater)
  - Seastate not good for shallow waters, it doesn't take into account wave period.
- What he's tried before:
  - This has been a long problem
  - He's tried mowing the lawn techniques, but this is really slow; there's no real time feedback
  - They couldn't get into shallow water
  - They also used to manually do this with boats anmd CTD sensors
- Where in the water column is the plume typically?
  - They tend towards the ground. but the whole column needs to be canvassed. 
- Operational range
  - < 1 kilometer
- Three sectors: open ocean, inlet, estuary
  - We'll need to conquer all three
  - We may stay in the estuary
  - Plumes are generally around the dredge operation, but it DEPENDS on the tide; 
  - Ebb-tide; flood tide
  - From sound to ocean is ebb
  - ocean to sound is flood
  - Inlets with jets (concrete moorings) don't need to be dredged because they keep themselves clean.
